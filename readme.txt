We began the data cleaning process by uploading and scoping the data. 
Beginning with the happiness dataset, we added a column to each year's independent datasets to show which year they correspond to before merging them together to create a dataframe. 
We also renamed columns for consistency, and dropped any columns that didn't appear in the datasets for all years.
